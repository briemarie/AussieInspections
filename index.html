              <h4>How to complete this report</h4>
              <p>
                1.Three copies of this condition report are filled out and signed by
                the landlord or the landlord's agent.
                <br>
                2.Before the tenancy begins, the landlord or the landlord's agent
                must inspect the residential premises and record the condition
                of the premises by indicating whether the particular room item
                is clean, undamaged and working by placing "Y" (YES) or "N"
                (N0) in the appropriate column (see example below). Where
                necessary, comments should be included in the report. The
                landlord or the landlord's agent must also indicate "yes" or "no"
                in relation to the matters set out under the headings "Health
                issues" and "Communications facilities".
                <br>
                3.If the tenant has agreed to pay for water usage charges under
                the residential tenancy agreement, the landlord or landlord's
                agent must also indicate whether the residential premises have
                the required water efficiency measures.
                <br>
                4.Two copies of the report which have been filled out and
                signed by the landlord or the landlord's agent must be given
                to the tenant before or when the tenant signs the agreement.
                The landlord or landlord's agent keeps the third copy.
                <br>
                5. As soon as possible after the tenant signs the agreement, the
                tenant must inspect the residential premises and complete the
                tenant section of the condition report. The tenant indicates
                agreement or disagreement with the condition indicated by
                the landlord or landlord's agent by placing "Y" (YES) or "N"
                (N0) in the appropriate column and by making any appropriate
                comments on the form. The tenant may also comment on the
                matters under the headings "Health issues", "Communications
                facilities" and "Water efficiency devices".
                <br>
                6. The tenant must return one copy of the completed condition
                report to the landlord or landlord's agent within 7 days after
                receiving it and is to keep the second copy.
                <br>
                7. At, or as soon as practicable after, the termination of the tenancy
                agreement, both the landlord and tenant should complete the
                copy of the condition report that they retained, indicating the
                condition of the premises at the end of the tenancy. This should
                be done in the presence of the other party, unless the other party
                has been given a reasonable opportunity to be present and has
                not attended the inspection.

              <h4>Important notes about this report</h4>
              <p>
                1. It is a requirement that a condition report be completed by the
                landlord and the tenant (see above). This condition report is an
                important record of the condition of the residential premises
                when the tenancy begins and may be used as evidence of
                the state of repair or general condition of the premises at the
                commencement of the tenancy. It is important to complete the
                condition report accurately. It may be vital if there is a dispute,
                particularly about the return of the rental bond money and any
                damage to the premises.
                <br>
                2. At the end of the tenancy the premises will be inspected and the
                condition of the premises at that time will be compared to that
                stated in the original condition report.
                <br>
                3. A condition report should be filled out whether or not a rental
                bond is paid.
                <br>
                4. If you do not have enough space on the report attach a separate
                sheet.
                <br>
